      <h1>BIOTECHNOLOGY</h1>
<p>At its simplest, biotechnology is technology based on biology - biotechnology harnesses cellular and biomolecular processes to develop technologies and products that help improve our lives and the health of our planet. We have used the biological processes of microorganisms for more than 6,000 years to make useful food products, such as bread and cheese, and to preserve dairy products.</p><br>

	<h3>HEAL THE WORLD</h3><br>

Biotech is helping to heal the world by harnessing nature's own toolbox and using our own genetic makeup to heal and guide lines of research by:
<ul>
<li>Reducing rates of infectious disease.</li>
<li>Saving millions of children's lives.</li>
<li>Changing the odds of serious, life-threatening conditions affecting millions around the world.</li>
<li>Tailoring treatments to individuals to minimize health risks and side effects.</li>
<li>Creating more precise tools for disease detection and
Combating serious illnesses and everyday threats confronting the developing world.</li>
</ul>

</p><br>

	<h3>FUEL THE WORLD</h3> <br>
Biotech uses biological processes such as fermentation and harnesses biocatalysts such as enzymes, yeast, and other microbes to become microscopic manufacturing plants. Biotech is helping to fuel the world by:
<ul>
<li>Streamlining the steps in chemical manufacturing processes by 80% or more</li>
<li>Lowering the temperature for cleaning clothes and potentially saving $4.1 billion annually.</li>
<li>Improving manufacturing process efficiency to save 50% or more on operating costs.</li>
<li>Reducing use of and reliance on petrochemicals.</li>
<li>Using biofuels to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 52% or more.</li>
<li>Decreasing water usage and waste generation and Tapping into the full potential of traditional biomass waste products.</li>	
</ul>

	<h3>MEDICINE</h3> 
In medicine, modern biotechnology has many applications in areas such as pharmaceutical drug discoveries and production, pharmacogenomics, and genetic testing (or genetic screening).

Pharmacogenomics (a combination of pharmacology and genomics) is the technology that analyses how genetic makeup affects an individual's response to drugs.Researchers in the field investigate the influence of genetic variation on drug responses in patients by correlating gene expression or single-nucleotide polymorphisms with a drug's efficacy or toxicity.The purpose of pharmacogenomics is to develop rational means to optimize drug therapy, with respect to the patients' genotype, to ensure maximum efficacy with minimal adverse effects.Such approaches promise the advent of "personalized medicine"; in which drugs and drug combinations are optimized for each individual's unique genetic makeup.<br>

Biotechnology has contributed to the discovery and manufacturing of traditional small molecule pharmaceutical drugs as well as drugs that are the product of biotechnology – biopharmaceutics. Modern biotechnology can be used to manufacture existing medicines relatively easily and cheaply. The first genetically engineered products were medicines designed to treat human diseases. To cite one example, in 1978 Genentech developed synthetic humanized insulin by joining its gene with a plasmid vector inserted into the bacterium Escherichia coli. Insulin, widely used for the treatment of diabetes, was previously extracted from the pancreas of abattoir animals (cattle or pigs). The genetically engineered bacteria are able to produce large quantities of synthetic human insulin at relatively low cost.Biotechnology has also enabled emerging therapeutics like gene therapy. The application of biotechnology to basic science (for example through the Human Genome Project) has also dramatically improved our understanding of biology and as our scientific knowledge of normal and disease biology has increased, our ability to develop new medicines to treat previously untreatable diseases has increased as well.<br>

Genetic testing allows the genetic diagnosis of vulnerabilities to inherited diseases, and can also be used to determine a child's parentage (genetic mother and father) or in general a person's ancestry. In addition to studying chromosomes to the level of individual genes, genetic testing in a broader sense includes biochemical tests for the possible presence of genetic diseases, or mutant forms of genes associated with increased risk of developing genetic disorders. Genetic testing identifies changes in chromosomes, genes, or proteins.Most of the time, testing is used to find changes that are associated with inherited disorders. The results of a genetic test can confirm or rule out a suspected genetic condition or help determine a person's chance of developing or passing on a genetic disorder. As of 2011 several hundred genetic tests were in use.Since genetic testing may open up ethical or psychological problems, genetic testing is often accompanied by genetic counseling.<br></p>
